# BoggleApplicationDemo_Frontend

A recreation of the classic game *Boggle*, ported to Android. It is also inspired by *Wordle* in that every player plays with the same board on any given day, provided and automatically generated by the remote server. This app also features a simple Google Maps activity and location-detecting services as proof of concept, unrelated to the Boggle game.

To play the game, download the APK on your Android device, located at 'app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk'. Click on the button that says "What's this?" to open the Boggle screen. Note that it can only be played if the remote Azure VM is active.

This is the Frontend repo, uploaded directly from Android Studio. [Here](https://github.com/Aledax/BoggleApplicationDemo_Backend) is the Backend repo link.

## Gameplay

On the Boggle screen, tap "Start" to start playing, upon which the app will fetch the current Boggle board from the server and start the countdown timer.

Words can be formed by dragging between the circled letters. Note that words must follow traditional *Boggle* rules to count for points:
- Words must be at least 3 letters long.
- Letters can only be used once per word.
- Each subsequent letter in the word must be adjacent to the previous letter on the grid (including diagonals).

When the timer runs out, your score will be uploaded to the server, and a message will show displaying your score percentile among all other score submissions for that day's board.

## Development Notes

This project was created with Android Studio, Node.js, MongoDB, and Azure Cloud Services.

Some useful experience I gained in this project:
- Android and XML development and frontend design
- Use of cloud services and VMs
- Nodejs, Expressjs, and MongoDB skills
